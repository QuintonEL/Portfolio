## About

Iâ€™m a web developer with previous experience as an electrical engineer. I have a passion for innovative technology and a relentless drive for continuous improvement in all of my endeavors. After coding during my engineering degree and as a hobby for years, in 2020 I finally decided to become serious about software engineering and did a 12-week bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs to jumpstart this pivot in my career.

Currently, I am working as a full stack developer, soaking up as much knowledge and practice as I can in an attempt to perfect my craft. I have experience using Javascript, SQL, Node.js, ReactJS, HTML, CSS, and PHP.

In addition to software development, I have interests including custom PC and mechanical keyboard building, and audio hardware. I am a former competitive squash player and powerlifter.
