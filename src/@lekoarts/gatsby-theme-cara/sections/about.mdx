## About

I am a recent graduate from Lighthouse Labs, Canada's leading coding bootcamp. I have a background of two years of work experience in the electrical engineering industry, and a strong passion for innovative technology, audio systems, and computer hardware/software. I got a taste of coding throughout my engineering degree but wanted to pursue it further and I have since fallen in love with it.
